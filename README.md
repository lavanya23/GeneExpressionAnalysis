# GeneExpressionAnalysis
Australia is on the second top list of breast cancer diseases, where every year 20000 people are
diagnosed . If detected earlier and by analyzing the data of cancer tissues and with appropriate treatment.
The number of cases can be reduced.
Gene Expression is a technique where instructions from DNA are converted into proteins. By Analyzing
Gene Expression will be able to identify which genes are responsible for irregular growth of cells(cancer)
which leads to drug discovery to improve patient mortality rate
In this project, I am going to Visualize the gene expression of different samples.
